I was a Professor in the [Department of Computing Science](http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/) at [the University of Alberta](http://www.ualberta.ca/). I received my BSc degree from [Northeastern University](http://www.northeastern.edu/) (USA) and my PhD from [Purdue University](http://www.purdue.edu/). After a year of post-doctoral training at the [University of Pennsylvania](http://www.upenn.edu/), I joined the U of A in 1988 where I currently hold an adjunct appointment.

My research interests include robotics, computer vision, and image processing. I have worked in a number of areas in robotics and, for the past 10+ years, my focus has been on visual robot navigation. In 2003-17, with support from the federal and provinncial goverments, I held an NSERC Industrial Research Chair to conduct research in computer vision and image processing that addresses the practical challenges facing Alberta's mining industry. As a member of the NSERC Strategic Network on Robotics ([NCRN](http://ncrn-rcrc.mcgill.ca/)) I work closely with Canadian academic colleagues and industrial partners on mobile robotics research. Within the international robotics community, my activities include a variety of roles in ICRA and IROS communities, as well as other IEEE RAS sponsored conferences.
