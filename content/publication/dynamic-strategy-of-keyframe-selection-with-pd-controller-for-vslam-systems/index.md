abstract: Keyframe (KF) selection in a KF-based visual simultaneous localization
  and mapping (VSLAM) system is critical. In previous studies, static thresholds
  have been used for KF selection decision making; however, suboptimal
  performance can result from the use of such thresholds. To obtain a better KF
  setting than that obtained with the existing methods, in this article, we
  introduce a dynamic KF selection strategy. By considering both the view change
  between camera observation and KFs in the built map and the rate of this
  change, we propose to dynamically adjust the threshold for KF selection. A
  proportion and derivative (PD) controller is designed with the feedback of
  estimated view change, where the PD controller output is used for KF
  selection. According to the experimental results, compared with the existing
  studies, our method can improve the precision of visual tracking by 17.5% and
  16.7% based on two popular VSLAM systems.
