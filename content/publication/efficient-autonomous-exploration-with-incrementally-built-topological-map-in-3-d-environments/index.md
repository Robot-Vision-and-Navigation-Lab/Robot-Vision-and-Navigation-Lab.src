abstract: Autonomous 3-D exploration with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is
  increasingly prevalent for environment monitoring without human intervention.
  In this article, we present a systematic solution toward efﬁcient UAV
  exploration in 3-D environments. Innovatively, a road map is incrementally
  built and maintained along with the exploration process, which explicitly
  exhibits the topological structure of the 3-D environment. By simplifying the
  environment, the road map can efﬁciently provide the information gain and the
  cost-to-go for a candidate region to be explored, which are two quantities for
  next-best-view (NBV) evaluation, thus prompting the efﬁciency for NBV
  determination. In addition, with reference to the global plan queried on the
  road map, we propose a local planner based on the potential ﬁeld method that
  drives the robot to the information-rich area during the navigation process,
  which further improves the exploration efﬁciency. The proposed framework and
  its composed modules are veriﬁed in various 3-D environments, which exhibit
  their distinctive features in NBV selection and better performance in
  improving the exploration efﬁciency than other methods.
