abstract: Robustness in on-road driving Visual Odometry (VO) systems is
  critical, as it determines the reliable performance in various scenarios and
  environments. Especially with the development of data-driven technology, the
  combination of data-driven VO and model-based VO has achieved accurate
  tracking performance. However, the lack of generalization of pre-trained deep
  neural networks (DNN) limits the robustness of such a combination in unseen
  environments. In this study, we introduce a novel framework with appropriate
  usage of DNN prediction and improve the robustness in the self-driving
  application. Based on the characteristic of on-road self-driving motion and
  the DNN output, we propose a two-step optimization strategy with a variable
  degree of freedom (DoF), i.e., the use of two types of DoF representations
  during pose estimation. Speciﬁcally, our two-step optimization operates
  according to the residual of the optimization with the motion label
  classiﬁcation from the pre-trained DNN, as well as our proposed Motion
  Evaluation by essential matrix construction. Experimental results show that
  our framework obtains better tracking accuracy than the existing methods.
