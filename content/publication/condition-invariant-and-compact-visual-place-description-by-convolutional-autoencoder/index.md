abstract: "Visual place recognition (VPR) in condition-varying environments is
  still an open problem. Popular solutions are CNN-based image descriptors,
  which have been shown to outperform traditional image descriptors based on
  hand-crafted visual features. However, there are two drawbacks of current
  CNN-based descriptors: a) their high dimension and b) lack of generalization,
  leading to low eﬃciency and poor performance in applications. In this paper,
  we propose to use a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) to tackle this problem. We
  employ a high-level layer of a pre-trained CNN to generate features, and train
  a CAE to map the features to a low-dimensional space to improve the condition
  invariance property of the descriptor and reduce its dimension at the same
  time. We verify our method in three challenging datasets involving signiﬁcant
  illumination changes, and our method is shown to be superior to the
  state-of-the-art. The code of our work is publicly available in
  https://github.com/MedlarTea/CAE-VPR."
